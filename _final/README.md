# Hello,

This is the website for the Energy Challenges Drenthe team: Zenergy. Our goal is to make the school durable.

And now for the code and stuff.
The website is based on the materialize.css framework. I've added my own color scheme and made some miner tweaks.
Therefore if you're planning to build a website with this sita as a starting point I really advise you to have a look at their website.
The most usefull things are the code snippets in my _config.yml and some of th files in the _includes folder.
